## Detail
This is basically a facebook like Social Media App with features such as status images, photo and video sharing, etc. with additional elements like a video playing platform which uses TMDB Api to fetch movie trailers from youtube and then embed them on screen if needed. Other than this, there's also a shopping platform which uses fake store api and Stripe Payments to attain full e-commerce funtionality. Last but not least there is a chatting platform where we can chat with anyone if we know their e-mail. 

Firebase has been used for storage and real-time database. This Project is also a Progressive Web App so it can be installed on mobile devices and con work offline after configuration.
